Selecting the different individual IDs will update the following:

1. The demographic data for that individual.

2. A bar graph demonstrating the top ten colonising organisms in the belly button of that individual by operational taxonomic units (OTU).

3. A bubble graph demonstrating the complete colonisation picture for the selected individual, where by color of the bubble  is representative of different OTU identifiers (organism), and the radius reflects the magnitude of growth of that organism (OTU value).
